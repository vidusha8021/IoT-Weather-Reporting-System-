# IoT-Weather Reporting System

This project is a weather monitoring system that sends environmental data to a cloud platform using Wi-Fi and MQTT for remote access.

## 


## Technologies

 - ESP32 Microcontroller: Responsible for sensor data collection, processing, and communication.
- IoT (Internet of Things): Enable real-time remote monitoring of weather data.

- Wi-Fi Communication: Connect the ESP32 to the internet for sending data to a cloud platform.

- MQTT Protocol: Lightweight communication protocol for efficiently transmitting sensor data to ThingsBoard.

- ThingsBoard: A cloud platform that collects, visualizes, and stores sensor data for remote monitoring and analysis.
